# **Endless End Game**  

Tired? We’re sure you are! 
After all we’ve covered, there’s only one thing left to do!!!

## **Hard-Stages!** 

Normal stages, with “hard” on their name!
They are the same stages as their normal counterparts, the only difference is the massive increase in combat power requirement. 

Most hard stage clears are posted on youtube, put in "NIKKE Hard stage X-X" and you should probably find a few clear videos of it.

The MegaGuide [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nikkemegaguide) also has a growing number of hard stage clears, go check it out!
