# Introduction

## **What is the purpose of this project?**

**Compile information about the game, process it, then present in the best form possible to any player interested. The guide is an eternal work in progress, and not all contents are covered at this moment, or at least, yet.**

## **There are others already doing that, so why?**

The main objective of the project is not to dethrone or invalidate other guides and websites, it is something from the community, to the community. We will compile everything regarding NIKKE, and present it to you. This game has a lot of content creators, tier lists, guides, websites, sheets, docs... However most players don't even know the existence of the majority of them. That's where we come through.

**Will there be a MegaGuide Tier List?**

Aside from the MLEM tier list, we don't plan to make one for character usefulness or strength. I will not say never, but it is something that we do not want to do. There are lots of tier lists out there already, one more is useless.

**Now, <span class="color-red">New players</span>**! The early game will be overwhelming as the vast majority of content NIKKE has is unlocked in the first few chapters. Also, don’t just read this guide, read as many guides as you can, watch videos, you name it! More information you have the better.

**<span class="color-red">Veteran players</span>**, if you want, go directly to the [Mid Game](midgame.md), [Late Game](lategame.md), or [End Game](endgame.md) section.
