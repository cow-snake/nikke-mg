# **Progression Walls** 

***Made possible thanks to KampretLordz, tio\_romano, gatrix, itsmomoland, kisenix, awesome21snake, excuseablepenguin and more\!***

**This list will be updated as soon as new chapters are added or early chapters are revisited.** 

**<span class="color-red">Up until chapter 18, borrowed NIKKEs can make the wall stages a joke. And as such, the wall only applies if you want to save the daily usage of them for a later chapter.</span>**

**Criteria:** These stages are either stat walls, manual play required, the raptures are specially difficult to deal with, or a combination of all the above. Bosses are generally “harder” than normal stages, however some bosses have very specific mechanics, and will hinder your progression by quite some time if you don’t want to learn said mechanics beforehand. 

**Do take note that all stages can be CP crushed, in other words, in a 10% or less CP deficit. This list will obviously not apply if not at least 15% deficit, with very few cases.**

The ones listed in **bold** are the hardest stages among the hard stages.

List of Raptures that will hinder your progression:

Servant Class

- Bullwhip (seahorse): Seahorse-like rapture, flying afloat on screen. Has a small hitbox so aiming can be tricky. Hits hard without much warning.  
- Crawler: A crab-like rapture that walks around on screen. Hits hard without much warning.  
- Lure: They can move fast in the air so it’s hard to aim at them. Same as Bullwhip, hits hard without much warning.  
- Glitter/Remnant (Kamikaze): As their epithet suggests, they jump on your Nikkes and deal a lot of damage (can 1 shot).  
- Capsule: So, you know the Kamikaze mechanics? Now, we put an elemental shield to protect them and THEN they jump on your Nikke. First introduced in chapter 25\.  
- Bird/Ant: A new type of Kamikaze introduced in chapter 29\. Nikkes ignore them so you have to aim manually.  
- Cube (volley): Spams volley shots on your Nikke.  
- Dagger: Throws a hitcount black ball. If there are too many, it will overwhelm your Nikkes, especially if you don’t bring an MG. Introduced in Chapter 19\.  
- Drifter: If you ignore them, they will explode. They deal damage to your Nikkes that CANNOT be dodged. Stuns your Attacker Nikkes (Supporters and Defenders are not affected). Introduced in Chapter 23\.  
- Volleyball: This ball-shaped creature flies around and attacks you after you deal damage to it. You have to hit them with 1 strong-shot or just wipe using Distribute/Wipe Damage attacks. If you ignore them, they jump to your Nikke and suicide. Introduced in chapter 33\.

Master Class

- Bronchus (fart): Hits all your Nikkes with radiation attack (players call it a fart attack), this cannot be dodged. Overheal (just heal up the damage you receive) solves this type of attack.  
- Glasses: You need to hit them hundreds of times to break its shield. It heals all raptures when alive. You need to bring MG type Nikkes to kill it. Introduced in chapter 19  
- Launcher (silencer): It spawns Batteries that silences your Nikkes, blocking their ability to burst. Introduced in chapter 23\.  
- Jellyfish: A jellyfish-like rapture, it binds to 1 your Nikkes, debuffs reload speed and slowly kills your Nikke. Introduced in chapter 21\.  
- Sentry (chain): Binds your Nikke with a chain that stuns her for a long time if they are not killed. This rapture is usually tanky.  
- Barbell: A high defense rapture. Combined with a healer type rapture, this would be the tankiest rapture you can face.   
- Satellite: A flying rapture, charges a massive attack onto a Nikke, then barrages them twice.  
- Orchestrion / Screamer (piano): A rapture that is shaped identical to a piano. Barrages your Nikke with a lot of attacks.  
- Joint (worm/inferno): A worm-like Rapture that floats and damages a Nikke over a long duration, similar to Inferno Tower on Clash of Clans / Clash Royale.
